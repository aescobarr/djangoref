    <ul>
        <li>
            Added georeferencing protocol field to Site name versions. This field allows specifying the protocol used
            during georeferencing.
        </li>
        <li>
            Added links to Darwin Core fields which have a direct correspondence with Site name and Site name version
            fields, as previous step to allowing import from and to Darwin Core format.
        </li>
        <li>
            Added description fields to Lookup tables, both at Lookup table and Lookup table element level.
        </li>
        <li>
            When filtering a group of Site names from the Site name list filter, we now zoom to the filtered elements
            extent on the map.
        </li>
        <li>
            Deleting any element in the application is restricted to admin users.
        </li>
        <li>
            Added Version copy button to Site name versions. This button replicates the fields from one version to another
            to reduce edition effort.
        </li>
        <li>
            Added visual help which highlights on the map the selected Site name, whether clicking on the individual element
            on the map or selecting through the binocular icon on the Site names table.
        </li>
        <li>
            Added a check before adding a new Site name which warns the user of similarly named Sites, to avoid as much
            as possible accidentally adding duplicate info.
        </li>
    </ul>
